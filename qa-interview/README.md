# QA Engineering Technical Assessment

Welcome to the Synmax Frontend QA Engineering technical assessment! This assessment is designed to evaluate your skills in various aspects of quality assurance, including end-to-end testing and unit testing. First task is required; the other 2 tasks are to gauge your depth of knowledge.

## Project Overview

You'll be working with a Todo application built with React and TypeScript. The application includes:

- A frontend UI for managing todos
- Common components for handling todos

## Assessment Structure

#### Note: You are allowed to add any additional public open source libraries (MIT Licence) that may assist you in this assessment.

### Task 1: E2E Testing (Required)

1. Set up the testing environment using Cypress/Playwright for E2E testing (Application is setup for Cypress but not stopping you from setting up Playwright)
2. Create test data fixtures and demonstrate proper test data management
3. Create your first E2E test for adding a todo item
4. Add any additional E2E tests as you see fit

### Task 2: Component Unit Tests (Optional)

1. Add component tests for the TodoList and Input components

### Task 3: Additional Testing (Optional)

1. Implement performance testing scenarios
2. Add error handling test cases
3. Create a test automation strategy document

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run tests:

```bash
# Unit tests
npm run test

# E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

```

## Assessment Requirements

### 1. End-to-End Testing

- Use Cypress for E2E testing
- Cover critical user flows
- Implement proper test organization
- Handle asynchronous operations correctly

### 2. Unit Testing

- Achieve good test coverage for utility functions
- Implement proper mocking strategies
- Write clear test descriptions
- Follow testing best practices

## Evaluation Criteria

You will be evaluated on:

1. Code quality and organization
2. Testing best practices
3. Error handling
4. Documentation
5. Test coverage
6. Progressive problem-solving approach

## Submission

1. Create a new branch with your name
2. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
3. Push your branch and create a pull request
4. Include any additional documentation in the PR description

Good luck!
